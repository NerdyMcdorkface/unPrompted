# unPrompted Version One 
### 1.0.0 
A throwback style bashrc replacement with some colorful single line and double line style PS1, inspired by Kali Linuxs default  look in the terminal. Tested well on Arch but should work just as well in any modern distro. You will need the ip command as it will display your external IP address inline beside a local IP address. It's fine to remove it comment out this feature should you desire to do so. I will be adding a couple new versions for use with Termux on android as IP addresses are not working without root, the socket is not allowed so make sure you are using the correct release. I recommend using the install script as it will backup your existing bashrc file before replacing and sourcing the new one. This is fine tondo manually also if you prefer. I did this as a learning experience I hope someone else gets some enjoyment from it also.
