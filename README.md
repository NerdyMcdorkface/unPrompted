# unPrompted Version One 
### 1.0.0 
A 'colorful' and cool, fairly 'simp-chimp'(me) bash prompt err...'enhancement',
which *should* work well with basically *any* distro, features:
 - gradient colors
 - single/double/triplet color &/or icon
 - classic 'bar' style brackets (think Kali Linux - 'Backtrack' vibes)
 - includes clown show with Agentic AI just for *CrInGe*
 - my dude Copilot was struggling and throwing as much distance as possible
 - Copilot made about 45 references back to Claude to make it crystal clear whom was NOT going to be last gen when repo is pushed to Github.
 - Claude-Code = Beast.
 - Vibe Code. IDC if you Full Stack some yet to be JS, it's a hoot with inline on trust me.
 - Use/mod/sell/idc don't be evilLooking at you now Gemini whaddup...?
    
  Have fun and mod it up.
